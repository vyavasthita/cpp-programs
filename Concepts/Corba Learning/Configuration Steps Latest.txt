Steps for CORBA;-

Prerequisites;-
	yum install gcc-c++
	yum install gcc
	
1. Copy mico.tgz tar and Untar/Unzip it in particular location in your system
   Say '/home/local/Downloads/'
   
   gtar xvzf mico.tgz 
   it will give you directory named '/home/local/Downloads/mico'
   
2. Configure mico
	Go to /home/local/Downloads/mico
	and run
	./configure --prefix=/home/local/Documents/sect/package/mico_2.3.12 --disable-threads
	
3. Install mico
	Go to /home/local/Downloads/mico
	and run
	
	make
	make install
	
4. Set library search path

	Execute the below commands as super/root user.
	-----------------------------------------------

	Step 1: Create a new file under /etc/ld.so.conf.d/ directory named <library>.conf

	Step 2: Add the library path in the newly created file.

	Step 3: Run ldconfig command to load the new search path.
	
	Example;-
		echo "/home/local/Documents/sect/package/mico_2.3.12/lib" > /etc/ld.so.conf.d/mico.conf && ldconfig
	
	Checking if a given library is in search path
		`ldconfig -p | grep mico`
		
5. Set Mico environment path

	echo "Setting Mico CORBA environment path"
	MICO_HOME='/home/local/Documents/sect/package/mico_2.3.12'
	export PATH=$PATH:$MICO_HOME/bin

6. Compile IDL
	for c++ specific target use following;-
		idl --c++-skel mytime.idl
	
	Other options;-
			-> idl <name>.idl
	or		-> idl -i <name>.idl
	or 
			
7. Create Makefile
	Add mico lib path
	Add mico include path
	Add mico libraries
	Client code needs stub
	Server code needs both stub and skeleton

8. Write server source code with servant and main function and generate bin for server	

9. Write client source code and generate bin for client

10. Execute Server
	./server >/tmp/server.ref &

11. Execute Client
    ./client `cat /tmp/server.ref &`
	
10. Kill Server
	kill myserver
	kill %1
